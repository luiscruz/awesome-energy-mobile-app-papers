# Awesome Mobile App Energy Papers
[![Awesome](./media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

As a result of my research as a PhD student (supervised by [Prof. Rui Abreu](https://ruimaranhao.com)), I have listed academic literature that is related to the energy efficiency of mobile applications.

The goal of this list is to provide relevant academic papers to mobile developers, researchers, and students that want to extend their knowledge in this research topic.

If you know an academic paper that should be listed here, please contribute. As rule of thumb, the paper needs to be accepted in a relevant peer-reviewed conference/journal. Please, read the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md).

This list is based on similar lists for other topics: [Awesome Crypto Papers](https://github.com/pFarb/awesome-crypto-papers); [Stack Exchange Academic Papers](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134495/academic-papers-using-stack-exchange-data). It is sorted by year. Eventually, the papers might be categorized according to their approach and addressed problem.
